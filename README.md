# Work Day Scheduler

This website is a work day scheduler that helps you keep track of your daily tasks. You can enter your to-do list for the day, and the website will highlight which tasks are past due, which are due soon, and which have already been completed.

## Getting Started

To use this website, simply visit the following URL: https://darylbg.github.io/work-day-scheduler/. You can then enter your tasks for the day by clicking on the text boxes next to each hour of the work day.

The live website page will look similar to this: [!screenshot](assets/images/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)

## Features

- Color-coded task entries: Tasks that are past due will be highlighted in red, tasks that are due soon will be highlighted in yellow, and tasks that have already been completed will be highlighted in green.
- Local storage: Your task entries will be saved to your browser's local storage, so you can close the website and come back to it later without losing your progress.
- Mobile-friendly: The website is designed to work well on mobile devices, so you can use it on-the-go.
